### Who are they? Is this a B2B or B2C relationship?

## Activation
### How do they get a customer to care?
  - To get customers to care about their coffee/tea we offer [coffee tasting events](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMqL2XChW86/?igshid=17sfc4cfi1b9b). This only requires you to book a table on our website and to show up! We show you how to create three different coffees with the same coffee bean.
### What happens when they do?
  - When customers start to care about their coffee, they will look towards our subscription boxes or just shop for their preferred coffee bean through our [website](https://www.soughtxfound.coffee/shop).
### How would this be measured?
  - The success of the events can be measured by the amount of likes, comments, follower growth and clicks per post. The success of selling subscription boxes/coffee bags can be compared to our average selling rate to the time after the event. The [Kissmetrics](https://neilpatel.com/) tool can be used to track customer data.

## Retention
### How is a returning customer defined?
  - A returning customer is defined as a customer who has once shopped at our cafe before and has come back for a second time during a certain time period.
### How are returning customers measured?
  - Returning customers can be measured by a membership service like that of Starbucks. [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/mobile-apps) has created an app where a customer once signed up can accumulate points to earn a free beverage. This will measure the how often and the amount of times a customer returns to the cafe.
### How are one-time customers followed up on?
  - One time customers can be followed up by offering them to subscribe to our mailing list so they can be updated on our promotions and products. This can be done over email or more preferably phone number so if there are any questions the customer has we can reply faster and more efficiently. Another method to keep a good relationship with any customer is to do it right from the start, we will also offer a customer comment card "service" (if they would like to participate) to let us know what we can improve on and what they enjoyed about our services.
